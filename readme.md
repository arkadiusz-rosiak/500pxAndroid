#500px.com Android Simple Client

This is my final project on Android Course at Adam Mickiewicz University. It has 3 activities:

* Photos List (Popular/Highest rated/Fresh today)
* Photo details
* Settings

On photos list only small photo resolutions are downloaded. List have endless scroll. Also Not Save For Work content is filtered.

In photo details you can see higher resolution photo and some camera details.

Finally in settings you can change results per page and categories to display.

Target SDK is **24 (Android 7.0)** and min SDK is **21 (Android 5.0)**
